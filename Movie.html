                <p id="p1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg"> Amandla Stenberg </a> gives a masterful performance in The Hate U Giveâ€”an equally heartbreaking and eye-opening film about main character Starr (Stenberg) who's stuck navigating between two worlds: the prep school she attends that reeks of white privilege and the mostly Black neighborhood where she lives that's harmed by police brutality. It's based on Angie Thomas's 2017 novel.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American teen comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by John Hughes, and co-produced by Tom Jacobson. The film stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, a high-school slacker who skips school for a day in Chicago, with Mia Sara and Alan Ruck. Ferris regularly breaks the fourth wall to explain his techniques and inner thoughts.
                    Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week. Filming began in September 1985 and finished in November. Featuring many Chicago landmarks, including the then Sears Tower, Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago, the film was Hughes's love letter to Chicago: "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could. Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit."[3]  
                    In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant</p>

Your next challenge: Figuring out exactly which of the great movies available to you is the one you're going to commit to tonight. No matter what you're looking forâ€”romance, drama, comedyâ€”there are plenty of classics to watch in your spare time. After all, if the past year-and-a-half cooped up in our homes has taught us anything, it's that there's nothing better than a movie to take us to a place that's far, far away from our current one. These are modern classics, the best of the best, the essential movies that millions of people are probably jealous that you're getting to see for the first time. There are a few that might be outside your comfort zone, and a couple that'll introduce you to cultures and environments you know nothing about. This list may be long, but FOMO is eternal. Here are the essential films absolutely everyone should see (and if you've seen them, ones to watch again and again).<img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/must-watch-movies-1607443952.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=980:*"></p>
